## Let's build the new Vitamin

We are thrilled to announce the upcoming new version of our Decathlon design system. This current version of Vitamin will no longer evolve, as we will replace it with a more modern stack that will take into account all accessibility criteria, will include evolving design tokens, and will be compatible with Right To Left. This new version will be a result of our (almost) three years of experience, along with numerous feedback received from the community via the Scorecard, surveys, interviews, and GitHub issues.

We would like to thank everyone who has already participated in various tests and workshops. Your valuable feedback will help us to create an even better version of Vitamin. This new version of our design system will be launched later this year as an inner source project with the aim of being open sourced in 2024. We are confident that it will meet all your design and engineering needs.

**Please note that our current version of Vitamin will only accept bug fixes from now on.** We will focus on building this new version, and will encourage you to migrate to the new version for an enhanced experience, when it will be deployed.

We understand that migration can be challenging, and we want to assure you that we will facilitate the process as much as possible. We are excited to take this new step and look forward to continuing our journey with you all. Thank you for your ongoing support.
