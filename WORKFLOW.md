# Vitamin workflow

To manage work and track the progress of our tasks, we use GitHub Projects that allows us to create a kanban board to organize and prioritize our work.

[See our board](https://github.com/orgs/Decathlon/projects/3)

## From issue to kanban board

When you [create an issue](https://github.com/Decathlon/vitamin-design/issues/new/choose), we read it, we labelize it and then we add it to our https://github.com/orgs/Decathlon/projects/3.

## Columns

Here are the columns on our board and the purpose of each column:

| Column                | Purpose                                                                                                                                 |

## Workflow

Here is an example of how work might flow through the columns on your kanban board:

1. An issue is opened and added to our board _(so, automatically positioned to the 🆕 New column)_.
2. The issue is triaged and moved to the 📋 Backlog column thanks to our weekly core team's backlog grooming session _(only if it's not a bug)_.
3. The issue is moved to the 🔖 Ready to design column when it is ready to be designed.
4. The issue is moved to the 🏗 Design in progress column while it is being designed.
5. When the design is complete, the issue is moved to the 👀 Design review column for review.
6. If the design is approved, the issue is moved to the 👍 Design done column.
7. If the issue requires development, it is moved to the 🔖 Dev to do column when it is ready to be worked on by a developer.
8. The issue or pull request is moved to the 💻 Dev in progress column while it is being actively worked on by a developer.
9. When development is complete, the issue or pull request is moved to the 👀 Dev review column for review.
10. If the review is successful, the issue or pull request is moved to the ✅ Done column.
